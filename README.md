This is a combined frontend and backend blog project system. The Myblog directory, written in IntelliJ IDEA, contains both frontend and backend code. The ptu-blog-vue(1) and x-admin-web directories are written in Visual Studio Code; the former serves as the user login portal, and the latter serves as the admin login portal.

To run the project, you need to run the frontend and backend parts correspondingly.

For the User Login Portal:

Run the blog part of the code in the Myblog directory.
Then, navigate to the ptu-blog-vue(1) directory and enter the following command in the integrated terminal: npm run dev.
Copy the address output from the terminal and open it in your browser.
For the Admin Login Portal:

Run the admin part of the code in the Myblog directory.
Then, navigate to the x-admin-web directory and enter the following commands in the integrated terminal:
npm install
npm run dev
Copy the address output from the terminal and open it in your browser.
